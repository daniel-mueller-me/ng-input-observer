# ng-toolkit - until a awesome name was found

## What this is all about

This project is about unleashing Angular's & Typescripts superpowers to make our work as developers, frontend guru, trainee and everyone else who likes Angular as enjoyable as it can be. 

We want to create a library that provides a variety of helpers that take over frequently repeating tasks in building Angular applications.
These helpers should be implemented so simply that they are independent of any third-party library.

Every single bit can be used but do not have to.

## What it is not about

To deliver the kryptonite as well

## Status

There are still some ideas and maybe a branch or two

## Rodmap
