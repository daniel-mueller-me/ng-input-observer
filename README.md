# ng-toolkit - until a awesome name was found

## What this is all about

This project is about unleashing Angular's superpowers to make our work as developers, frontend gurus, trainees and everyone else who likes Angular as enjoyable as it can be.

- Developers should like it
- Frontend Gurus should love it
- Trainees and everyone else don't need to know how, but that it works and how to use it

We want to create a library that provides a variety of utilities that take over frequently repeating tasks in building Angular applications.
These utilities are supposed to be small and simple and independent of third-party libraries.
Every single bit can be used but do not have to.

This sounds too ambitious? ... Well, maybe it is. We'll see.
